The project is to  create a trivia form with multiple choice questions.
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
The player cannot pick more than one answer per question.
A countdown timer is included in the page to inform the user how much time is left..

When the page is loaded, it is loaded with a start button. On clicking the start button, the game starts. A set of 5 multiple choice questions along with a count down timer are displayed 
The user has to pick his choice by clicking the radio button next to each option of each question. he has an option ot answer the questions before the timer becomes 0 seconds .
The game ends when the timer reaches 0 seconds or when the user clicks the done button..After the game is done, the no, of correct and wrong answerw is displayed.
