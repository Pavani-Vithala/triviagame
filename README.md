# triviagame

The project is to  create a trivia form with multiple choice questions.
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
The player cannot pick more than one answer per question.
A countdown timer is included in the page to inform the user how much time is left..

When the pag eis loaded, it is loaded with a set of 5 multiple choice questions along with a count down timer. 
The user has to pick his choice by clicking the radio button next to each option of each question. 
The game ends when the timer reaches 0 seconds.After the game is done, the no, of correct and wrong answerw is displayed.

The project is maintained by Pavani Vithala who can be reached on pavani.vithala18@gmail.com.
